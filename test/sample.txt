AI Chatbot Development Roadmap

This document outlines the proposed roadmap for developing a custom GPT-powered chatbot with a knowledge base. The project is divided into five phases, each building upon the previous one.

Phase 1 – Prototype (1.5–2 weeks, $1.5k–$2k range)
- File upload (.txt, .pdf) → embeddings (Pinecone)
- Categorization & metadata tagging
- Simple web chat UI (Next.js)
- Retrieval + GPT responses with citations
- Deployed prototype (cloud or local)

Goal: Validate workflow & prove concept

Phase 2 – SaaS MVP (2–3 weeks, ~$2k–$3k)
- User Accounts & Auth (email/OAuth login)
- Persistent Chat History tied to user profiles
- Basic Subscription/Paywall (Stripe integration, one paid plan)
- Admin Dashboard for file uploads + knowledge base management
- Light Analytics: usage stats, token spend per user
- Personalization (v1): track user interests & influence retrieval

Goal: First usable SaaS app with paying users

Phase 3 – Advanced Ingestion & Features (3–3.5 weeks, ~$3k–$4k)
- Support More Formats: DOCX, URLs, web articles
- YouTube/Audio Ingestion: automatic transcription → embeddings
- Improved Categorization: hybrid GPT + clustering model for consistency
- Enhanced Source Referencing: richer citation UI, filters by source/author
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for orgs/teams

Goal: Broader ingestion, more robust knowledge base, enterprise-ready features starting to emerge

Phase 4 – Production Hardening & Launch Prep (2–3 weeks, ~$2k–$3k)
- Multi-Tenancy Support: orgs, workspaces, and roles
- Tiered Subscriptions: multiple plans, quotas, usage metering
- Security & Compliance: encrypted storage, PII redaction, audit logs
- Observability: monitoring, alerts, logging
- Scalable Deployment (AWS/GCP + autoscaling)
- UX Polish: optimized chat UI, responsive design, onboarding flows

Goal: SaaS product stable and secure for public launch

Phase 5 – Growth & Personalization (ongoing, modular pricing)
- Advanced Analytics: user insights, org dashboards
- Deep Personalization: adaptive ranking, long-term interest models
- Marketplace/API: allow customers to connect external data sources
- Mobile Support (optional)

This roadmap provides a clear path from prototype to production-ready SaaS application, with each phase delivering incremental value while building toward a comprehensive AI-powered knowledge management solution.
